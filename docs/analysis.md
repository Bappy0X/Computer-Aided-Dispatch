# :one: Analysis

## Problem Definition

The emergency services, delivery services, taxi’s and other private companies all require and rely on “Computer Aided Dispatch” software. This is used to keep track of jobs, track and periodically update records, monitor the workforce and provide better customer service.

These software’s are extremely useful and assist in strategically planning the rotation of resources and assets for a company. This helps to cut down costs and ensure that the workforce is performing as it should, creating rules and tasks on the fly.

CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) software is also extremely useful for the general public, a client, or customer. Tracking ETA’s of emergency service personnel, deliveries, and taxi’s mean that clients can go by their business, rather than wait.

## Before Computers

Pen and paper are extremely inefficient methods of tracking and analysing any process. Requiring excessive amounts of human interaction, pen and paper are more likely to fail.

People can stray on their own path, leading away from protocols and instructions, which within a dispatch environment, are vital they are followed as lives may depend on it.

Ultimately, computers follow a set of explicit instructions, and nothing else - this fundamentally improves the safety and reliability of any dispatch system.

### Incorporating a Computational Solution

1. **Able to directly view workforce performance**
This allows for advanced analytics of your workforce. You're able to ensure that your employees and colleagues are working effectively via graphs and charts.
2. **Decreased costs to the company**
    1. **Server architecture rather than paper and pen**
        1. Clients won't overpay for assets (like paper and pens) that they don't require. Instead, they're able to buy exactly what they need - a server.
        2. There's less human interaction - fundamentally decreasing the rate of failure.
        3. You have an instant access to records - there's no delay or frustration rummaging through physical papers trying to find exactly what you need.
        4. It's easier to archive and back up data, and request it when you need it. This makes reports a lot easier.
    2. **Training**
    However, the workforce may need to be retrained in order to use this new system. Whilst some may not have appropriate experience or contact with software, so it may be more difficult to understand.

There are many limitations to using paper and pen...
