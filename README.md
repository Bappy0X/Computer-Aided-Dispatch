# Computer-Aided-Dispatch

> A modern &amp; featureful CAD system.

This is a Computer Aided Dispatch system aimed towards many crowds, including; the emergency services, taxi services, and other private companies.
I plan to use this as an "A-Level Computer Science Practical Programming Project" (quite the title)
